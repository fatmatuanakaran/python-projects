# python-projects
This is the place where I will be uploading my Python projects.

Welcome, and thank you for checking out my Python repository! I will be putting my Python practice projects here to organise them and show them to the world. Have a nice stay here!
Please note that I am still a beginner in learning software and how to use Git/GitHub so please excuse any errors I may make. I am self-learning and very excited to learn more as times goes by. Have a great day! :-)
